INTRODUCTION: 

The Bloodied Stings of Barovia is a new dark adventure for Baldur's Gate 2: Enhanced Edition. It takes the Child of Bhaal and their party to Barovia, part of the realm of Ravenloft. In this ominous land, the player will face new enemies and formidable creatures, solve intricate riddles, and experience a gripping gothic horror story. Immerse yourself in mists, navigate dangerous forests, and confront undead creatures, all while seeking your way back to Athkatla. 

The quest was designed for characters of level 12 or higher with some magical gear. To begin the adventure, locate a new entrance within the Athkatla Graveyard and step through a red portal you'll encounter there. Beware, however, as once you cross this threshold, you won't be able to return home until you've completed most of the quests that await you on the other side. 

This mod is part of a new series - The Dreadful Tales - which revolves around horror, death, dread, and the enigmatic Ravenloft, the Domains of Dread.  



INSTALLATION & COMPATIBILITY:

As with any other WeiDU mod: unzip the archive into your Baldur's Gate 2: Enhanced Edition directory and run Setup-ModName.exe. Note that this mod requires an up-to-date EE version of the game. To ensure the mod works fine, it is best to start a new game. The mod should be compatible with most WeiDU mods.

This project is a fan creation, and it was made for other fans. The original characters were developed by BioWare (original Baldur's Gate) and Beamdog (EE/Siege of Dragonspear). Thanks for your great work, devs! And thanks to all the people who give my mods a chance and try them out. You are all great.
